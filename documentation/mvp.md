**Application: "Senioryzator" (MVP)**

Create a personal website for a developer/mentor to showcase achievements and manage consultations.

**MVP Scope:**

*   **Consultation Booking:** Allow users to book consultations, triggering automated email confirmations.
*   **User Accounts:** Basic login/registration for users to view their consultation history and access free materials.
*   **Q&A:** A website form for users to ask questions (sent via email), with automated replies.
*   **Mentor Showcase:** Display the mentor's publications/activities on a timeline.
*   **Content Display:** A home page featuring statically displayed free materials.

**Specifically Excluded from MVP:**

*   **No Payments:** Payment processing is **not** included. Invoices will be handled manually after consultations.
*   **No Material Purchases:** Users cannot buy materials through the site in this version.
*   **No Site Configuration:** Basic MDX appearance customization is deferred.
*   **No Live Reviews:** Adding/displaying post-consultation reviews is out of scope.
*   **Single User Focus:** Not designed for multiple mentors/sites.

**Key Success Metric:**

*   Achieve 20 booked consultations within the first 2 months post-launch.
