# Guidelines for React

## Accessibility instructions

- Focus on semantic HTML structure
- Attach correct aria attributes for passed HTML node
- Add missing title and aria-roles
- Make sure generated HTML is readable for screen readers
- Make sure that tab navigation is working correctly
- All components should have exports like `export { ComponentName }` and `export type { ComponentNameProps }` at the bottom of the file
- Elements as `input` and `button` and other that has `type` property should have always explicitly defined type
- Use colors from defined palette inside [global.css](mdc:src/styles/global.css)
- Use polish language to describe accessibility roles, placeholders, titles, ...etc
- Every component should have a dedicated type for `props` exported at the bottom of the file
